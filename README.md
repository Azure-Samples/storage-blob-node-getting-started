# Getting Started with Azure Blob Service in Node.js

Demonstrates how to use the Blob Storage service.
Blob storage stores unstructured data such as text, binary data, documents or media files.
Blobs can be accessed from anywhere in the world via HTTP or HTTPS.

If you don't have a Microsoft Azure subscription you can
get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212)

## Running this sample

This sample can be run using either the Azure Storage Emulator that installs as part of Microsoft Azure SDK, which is only available in Windows - or by
updating the connection string in the app.config file with your account name and key.
To run the sample using the Storage Emulator (Microsoft Azure SDK):

1. Download and Install the Azure Storage Emulator [here](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/).
2. Start the Azure Storage Emulator (once only) by pressing the Start button or the Windows key and searching for it by typing "Azure Storage Emulator". Select it from the list of applications to start it.
3. Open the app.config file and set the configuration for the emulator ("useDevelopmentStorage":true).
4. Run the sample by: node ./blobSamples.js

To run the sample using the Storage Service

1. Open the app.config file and set the connection string for the emulator ("useDevelopmentStorage":false) and set the connection string for the storage service ("connectionString":"...")
2. Create a Storage Account through the Azure Portal
3. Provide your connection string for the storage service ("connectionString":"...") in the app.config file. 
4. Run the sample by: node ./blobSamples.js
